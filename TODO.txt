COMPUTATIONS + BLOCKCHAIN:

  - option to add token by address


  - add liq: without selecting pair: failing - let the 2nd token to be selected ?  or use GEM
    update_add_liquidity()

  - confirm-swap: show 'price udpated' section if the 'price' changes
    add 'disabled' to btn when price is updated
    re-enable the btn when click on Accept


  - not recognizing browser lang (on tablet)
  - it should show the selected lang in the box

  - use KRW if lang is korean - unless the user choose which one to use
  - option to choose price in USD or KRW


  - price impact calculation: the value is different depending on the route...
    maybe compute for all the routes and get the median value


  - test swap with multi-hops
  - test swap with exact output

  - check calculations for swap with the result from the swap

  - the tokens cannot be the same

  - test with tokens with different decimals

  - test with AERGO/WAERGO



  - when click on "Add <token>" (liq) and there is no amount, it could show msg



  BACKEND



  - NOT NOW: auto-router on a smart contract (?) - for speed - test

  - when adding liquidity and going to swap, it does not recognize the current pair


  - subscribe to events from the current selected token pair contract(s)
  - when a token is selected, unsubscribe, subscribe to a new pair (if some), and request pair info
    if using a multi-hop route, subscribe to each contract on the route/path
    if using many / split routes, subscribe to each contract on all the paths


  - use separate js files - with require or import
    "cat a.js b.js > concat.js && browserify concat.js -o bundle.js && rm concat.js"

  CONTRACTS

  - make aergo/waergo be the base token on new_pair (?) (on contract)




FRONTEND + UI:

  confirmation dialogs:
  - swap confirmation dialog     id="confirm-swap"
  - transaction sent dialog      id="confirm-transaction"
  - add liquidity confirmation   id="confirm-add-liquidity"
  - success & failure dialog     id="popup-message"
  - general message dialog (replace swal?)


  - user account dialog
    account info + history of txns + link to aergoscan (to check balances)
    allow to select another account?



  - show only 1 WAERGO token contract?
    use curated list of tokens?


  - store images/token logos on another place




//  √  if the pair is AERGO-WAERGO then just wrap/unwrap (on the swap)
//  √  and do not allow to create a pair

// if one of the tokens is AERGO, then it must use the waergo contract when:
// - making a swap
// - adding liquidity

// when creating a pair, if one is AERGO, use WAERGO as the token



TESTS:

  - test with the swap factory:
    - create pair
    - add liquidity
    - undo add first token
    - increase liquidity
    - remove liquidity
    - swap
    - routes
